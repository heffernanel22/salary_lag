#Load the salary data, revised with open refine and add a data column
```{r}
library(readr)
UNC_salaries <- read_csv("~/Documents/all data journalism/UNC_System_Salaries-20Search-20and-20Report-202-csv.csv",col_types = cols(`Total salary` = col_number ())) %>% mutate(date_hired = mdy(`Hire date`))

names(UNC_salaries) <- c("campus","name","department","position","title","null","total_salary","date_hired")

  

```

#PART ONE: GRAPHING FOR A GENERAL SENSE, do this in tableau too. 

#1. Graph the salaries of all associate professors v. the year they were hired. 
```{r}
UNC_associates <- UNC_salaries %>% filter(position == "ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR")

#986 associate professors 

ggplot(data = UNC_associates) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = date_hired, y = total_salary )) 

ggplot(data = UNC_associates) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = date_hired, y = total_salary )) +
  facet_wrap(~department)
```

#2. Graph the salaries of all assistant professors v. the year they were hired. 

```{r}
UNC_assistants <- UNC_salaries %>% filter(position == "ASSISTANT PROFESSOR")

ggplot(data = UNC_assistants) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = date_hired, y = total_salary )) 

ggplot(data = UNC_associates) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = date_hired, y = total_salary )) +
  facet_wrap(~department)
```

#3. Graph the salaries of all tenured professors v. the year they were hired. 
```{r}
UNC_professors <- UNC_salaries %>% filter(position == "PROFESSOR")

ggplot(data = UNC_professors) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = date_hired, y = total_salary)) 

ggplot(data = UNC_professors) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = date_hired, y = total_salary)) +
  facet_wrap(~department, nrow = 3)
```

#PART TWO: Calculating percent change in salary for employees hired in 2019 (or the most recent hire date in the decade) and 2010 (or the least hire date in the decade)

#1.This calculation will show the percent change in salary from 2010 to 2019 for associate professors, assistant professors, and professors separately. This is not separated by department. 

```{r}
UNC_salaries <- UNC_salaries %>% mutate(year = year(date_hired))
UNC_professors <- UNC_salaries %>% filter (position == "PROFESSOR" | position == "ASSISTANT PROFESSOR" | position == "ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR")

UNC_professors%>% group_by(position,year) %>% summarise(average = mean(total_salary)) %>%
pivot_wider(names_from = year,values_from = average) %>% mutate(percent_change = (`2019` - `2010`)/(`2010`))

```

#2. Create a new dataframe that show the percent change in salary for departments separately. 

```{r}
UNC_professors %>% group_by(department,year) %>% summarise(average = mean(total_salary)) %>%
pivot_wider(names_from = year,values_from = average)%>% mutate(percent_change =(`2019` - `2010`)/(`2010`))
  
```
#Note to self: Get around the N/As by using Tableau to determine what year(s) professors were hired. For example, no one may have been hired in 2010, but they may have been hired in 2011. Adjust!

#3.This calculation will show percent change, split by position, but only in the business school.

```{r}
UNC_professors %>% filter(department == "BUSINESS") %>% group_by(position,year) %>% summarise(average = mean(total_salary)) %>%
pivot_wider(names_from = year,values_from = average)%>% mutate(percent_change_assoc =(`2019` - `2010`)/(`2010`))%>% mutate(percent_change_assist =(`2019` - `2011`)/(`2011`)) %>% mutate(percent_change_tenure =(`2017` - `2010`)/(`2010`))
```

#4.This calculation will show percent change, split by position, but only in the dentistry school
```{r}
UNC_professors %>% filter(department == "DENTISTRY") %>% arrange(desc(year)) %>% group_by(position,year) %>% summarise(average = mean(total_salary)) %>%

```


#6. This calculation will show percent change, split by position, but only in the government school
```{r}
UNC_professors %>% filter(department == "GOVERNMENT") %>% arrange(desc(year)) %>% group_by(position,year) %>% summarise(average = mean(total_salary)) %>%
